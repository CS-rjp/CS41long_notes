        "* after the handler completes, the processor state is poped off the stack and execution resumes (like nothing ever happened)\r\n",

        "An interrupt is a signal sent to the processor that interrupts the current process. It may be generated by a hardware device or a software program. A hardware interrupt is often created by an input device such as a mouse or keyboard. An interrupt is sent to the processor as an interrupt request, or IRQ.\r\n",

        "The software assigns each interrupt to a handler in the interrupt table. An interrupt handler is just a routine containing a sequence of operations. Each of these may request input and output while running. Thus, an interrupt can be handled either as a thread or as a sub-process within a task or process.\r\n",

        "An IRQ or FIQ exception causes the processor hardware to go through a standard procedure (provided the interrupts are not masked): \r\n",
